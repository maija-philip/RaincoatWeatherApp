# RaincoatWeatherApp

Raincoat is weather app that shows you how to dress for the weather, should you wear shorts and t-shirt or bundle up in a hoodie or a coat. As a person who grew up on the west coast and is living on the east coast for college, I don't always know how to prepare for the weather. Dressing around humidity does not come naturally to me.
